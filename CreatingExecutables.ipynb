    "Two of the most common methods are functions and aliases. These are often put into one's ~/.bashrc file and are directly in the current shell environment. However sometimes with complicated functions, you might prefer having them as their own commands similar to $\\texttt{ls}$ in the $\\texttt{\\bin}$ directories. These are shell scripts that are designed to be executables, mini-programs. One of the nuances of these shell scripts however is allowing them to make changes to your current shell environment, as when they are called, they open a new \"subshell\" before returning to the original shell where the executable was initially called upon completion.
